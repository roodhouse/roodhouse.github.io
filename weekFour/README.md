# Week 3 / Module 3 Challenge

## Description 

### [Website](https://roodhouse.github.io/weekThree/)

Created a generate password application. Upon button click the app first asks the length of the password and then asks for different user character requirements.

Next the app randomly selects characters from each requirement that equaled true and stores them in arrays based on character requirement. For each true requirement the app  one by one cycles through the requirement arrays and randomly selects a single character until the password length is reached.

Once all the characters have been selected the app shuffles the new array so that similar character requirements are not group together in large blocks.

Finally the app writes the new shuffled password to the screen.

A copy to clipboard button then appears and will copy the contents of the password to the clipboard when clicked.
